## Description
           
This mood tracking app gives you the ability to track your mood and provides two credible forms, based on the National Library of Medicine, to calculate a weekly score. The forms are referred to as the Patient Health Care (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) form. You can share this information with your healthcare provider for better treatment decisions. Hope you enjoy!
